1This file contains a list of maps for use in map rotation.
This feature requires you are running a Windows OS (or can other wise run .bat files) and that you are using the tgstation-server toolset in tools/
#Lines starting with # are ignored.
Lines not inside map blocks are also ignored
Duplicated entries use the latter one.
All whitespace at the start and end of lines is ignored. (including indentation, thats just for show)
Format:
#map [map name] (name of .json file in _maps folder without the .json part)
minplayers [number] (0 or less disables this requirement)
maxplayers [number] (0 or less disables this requirement)
default (The last map with this defined will get all votes of players who have not explicitly voted for a map)
voteweight [number] (How much to count each player vote as, defaults to 1, setting to 0.5 counts each vote as half a vote, 2 as double, etc, Setting to 0 disables the map but allows players to still pick it)
max_round_search_span [number] (If this is nonzero, then if this map has been played more than a specified amount of times within this number of rounds, the map won't show up in votes. Max for this value determined by a define in persistence.dm)
max_rounds_played [number] (This determines how many times a map can be played within the above number of rounds before it's forbidden from votes.)
disabled (disables the map)
